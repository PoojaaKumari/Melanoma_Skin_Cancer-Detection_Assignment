# Melanoma Skin Cancer Detection

## Abstract
In the realm of cancer, there exist over 200 distinct forms. Among these, melanoma stands out as the most lethal type of skin cancer. The diagnostic journey for melanoma begins with clinical screening, followed by dermoscopic analysis and histopathological examination. Early identification of melanoma skin cancer significantly enhances its curability. The initial step in melanoma diagnosis involves a visual inspection of the affected skin area. Dermatologists capture dermatoscopic images of skin lesions using high-speed cameras, achieving an accuracy range of 65-80% in melanoma diagnosis without additional technical aids. When combined with further visual assessments by cancer treatment specialists and the utilization of dermatoscopic images, the overall prediction accuracy for melanoma diagnosis increases to 75-84%. This project aims to construct an automated classification system based on image processing techniques, leveraging skin lesion images for skin cancer classification.

## Problem Statement
Traditional skin biopsies involve dermatologists extracting a portion of the skin lesion and examining it under a microscope. Unfortunately, this process typically takes a week or more, from securing a dermatologist appointment to receiving the biopsy report. Our objective is to narrow this gap significantly by providing a predictive model. Leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), we classify nine types of skin cancer from outlier lesion images. This reduction in turnaround time has the potential to positively impact millions of individuals.

## Motivation
Our overarching mission is to contribute to the fight against skin cancer-related fatalities. The driving force behind this project lies in utilizing advanced image classification technology for the betterment of people's health. With the remarkable progress in computer vision, particularly in machine learning and deep learning, our approach is scalable across various domains.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises **2357 images** of malignant and benign oncological diseases, sourced from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). These images were meticulously categorized based on the ISIC classification, and each subset contains an equal number of images.

The dataset covers the following diseases:

To address class imbalance, we employed the Python package **Augmentor** (available at this link) to augment samples across all classes. This approach ensures that no class suffers from an insufficient number of samples.

## CNN Architecture Design
Our goal is to classify skin cancer using skin lesion images. To achieve superior accuracy and results in the classification task, we have developed a custom CNN model.

- **Rescaling Layer**: This layer rescales input values from the [0, 255] range to the [0, 1] range.
- **Convolutional Layer**: Convolutional layers apply convolution operations to the input, passing the results to subsequent layers. Convolutions aggregate information from receptive fields, reducing image size while consolidating relevant information into single pixels.
- **Pooling Layer**: Pooling layers reduce the dimensions of feature maps, thereby decreasing the number of learnable parameters and computational workload. These layers summarize features within specific regions of the feature map generated by a convolutional layer.

- **Dropout Layer**: During training, the Dropout layer randomly sets input units to zero with a specified frequency (dropout rate). This technique helps prevent overfitting by promoting robustness and generalization.

- **Flatten Layer**: Flattening converts data into a one-dimensional array, preparing it for input to subsequent layers. In our case, we flatten the output from convolutional layers to create a long feature vector, which is then connected to the final classification model (fully-connected layer).

- **Dense Layer**: The dense layer establishes deep connections between neurons. Each neuron in this layer receives input from all neurons in the preceding layer.

- **Activation Function (ReLU)**: The rectified linear activation function (ReLU) outputs the input directly if it is positive; otherwise, it outputs zero. ReLU mitigates the vanishing gradient problem, enabling faster learning and improved performance.

- **Activation Function (Softmax)**: Softmax is commonly used in the output layer of neural network models that predict multinomial probability distributions. It ensures that output probabilities range from 0 to 1, with their sum equaling one.
